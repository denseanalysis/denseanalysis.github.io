## DENSEanalysis: Cine DENSE Processing Software ##

This software was developed in MATLAB to provide a user-friendly way of
processing **d**isplacement **en**coding with **s**timulated **e**choes (DENSE)
image data. Currently, the software supports analysis of 2D cine DENSE images;
however, a beta version will be released in the coming months that supports
full biventricular 3D analysis.

### Getting Started

#### System Requirements

The current stable version (0.4.0) of *DENSEanalysis* requires:

* MATLAB (R2009b through R2014a)
* MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox
* MATLAB Curve Fitting Toolbox (Spline Toolbox in later versions)
* MATLAB C-Compiler

#### Configuration of Mex Compiler

If you have never compiled a MATLAB mex file on your current machine, you will
want to configure the MATLAB environment to be able to perform the compilation.
To do this you'll want to run

    mex -setup

This will lead you through a series of steps where MATLAB will detect all
compilers installed on your machine and ask you to select the appropriate
installer.

#### Removal of Previous Installations

If you have previously installed *DENSEanalysis*, make sure to remove any
existing entries in your path that point to that installation of
*DENSEanalysis* and restart MATLAB

To do this, you will want to select **Set Path** from the **File** menu. This
will bring up the path dialog in which you can select the folders to remove.

#### Download Software

The latest stable release of *DENSEanalysis* can be downloaded
[here](https://github.com/denseanalysis/denseanalysis/releases/latest) either
as a .zip or .tar.gz archive.

> If you wish to use a bleeding-edge version of DENSEanalysis or you
wish to contribute to DENSEanalysis, you can go to the DENSEanalysis [Github
page](https://github.com/denseanalysis/denseanalysis) and download the source
as needed.

Once downloaded, you'll want to extract the contents of the archive to a
directory of your choice on your machine.

Launch MATLAB and change folders to where you extracted the *DENSEanalysis*
software and run the `DENSEsetup` script to finish the installation of the
software.

    cd('path/to/DENSEanalysis') DENSEsetup

#### Running *DENSEanalysis* Programs

*DENSEanalysis* is launched by simply typing the following command within the
MATLAB command window

    DENSEanalysis

Similarly, *DENSEms* (Multi-Slice DENSE analysis) can be launched by using the
following command

    DENSEms
